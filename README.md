# Khan-Academy_Intro-to-computer-science-_Python
This repository documents my self-paced study of Python programming, based on the foundational curriculum of Khan Academy's Intro to Computer Science. The goal is to build a robust understanding of core concepts: variable handling, input/output, and mastery of complex conditional logic (if/elif/else and nested statements).

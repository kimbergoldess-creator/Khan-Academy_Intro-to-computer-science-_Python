# 🐍 Khan Academy: Python Logic & Fundamentals Journey 🤖

Hello there! I'm Kimbergoldess, and this repository is a structured log of my journey learning Python programming, based on the foundational concepts from the **[Khan Academy "Introduction to Computer Science"]** track.

Course Url: https://en.khanacademy.org/computing/intro-to-python-fundamentals

My focus is on mastering the fundamentals, with an emphasis on **writing clean, efficient code** and understanding complex **flow control**—a crucial skill for my other big interests and future focuses: Ethical Hacking and AI.

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap & Current Focus

This repo is organized by study **sprints**, corresponding **roughly** to one week of study at my own pace, not **necessarily** following the Khan Academy Unit logic. I will document my progression from basic math to advanced logic.

### ➡️ Sprint 1: Variables, I/O, and Basic Math

* **Objective:** Understand data types (`float`, `int`, `str`), basic arithmetic, and user interaction.
* **Key Script:** **[Phase_1/BMI_Calculator.py]** – My very first functional program to calculate and classify body mass index.

### ➡️ Sprint 2: Mastering Conditional Logic (If, Elif, Else)

* **Objective:** Conquer decision-making in code, including sequential checks and nested dependencies.
* **Key Achievements:**
    * **Logic Cascades:** Successfully used `if/elif/else` to manage mutually exclusive conditions (e.g., grading scores, classifying spending).
    * **Nested Logic (The Hard Part!):** Overcame the challenge of building dependent checks, such as the **[ATM_Withdrawal_Simulator.py]** where the pre-condition (positive balance) dictates the next step.
    * **🥳 First-Try Success!** The **[Phase_2/Software_Update_Control.py]** script was my first perfect solution for nested logic, correctly managing user permission and disk space checks on the first try.

### ➡️ Next Steps: Stay tuned!

## 💡 Code Philosophy

I come from a **humanities** background, and **although** I always had a soft spot for technology, I never managed to **truly** learn how to code. **So**, here I am, time to close this gap!

*(This space will eventually include more complex projects as my learning progresses to loops, lists, and data analysis.)*
